## Introduction

This Repository's main project `VisualDMC` implements a post-process for the Dual Marching Cubes algorithm, that resolves non-manifold geometry.
The code relies on the `C++17` standard and `CUDA 11.1`.

## Setup

To setup the projects, _CMake 3.18_ or newer is required (For CUDA Compatiblity Reasons).
Currently, this project only supports Windows (or rather, was only tested on a Windows machine).
Depending on the installed Graphics Card, `CMakeLists.txt` might have to be altered to match the card's architecture (check the comments in that file).
A list of values for each major architecture is included right at the point of its usage.
The main project is `VisualDMC`.

### Setup using CMake-Gui on Windows

- Run CMake-Gui and select the `code`-Directory as source. Choose a `build` folder, for example by creating a folder in the `code`-Directory. Click `Configure`, then `Generate`. After a successful generation, click `Open Project`. Right-Click the project that should be started and select `Set as startup project`, then build it.
- Extract the archive `Data-and-Results.zip` for example files. By default, the application loads the file `1-Edge.bin` from this extracted folder.

## References

The original implementation of the Dual Marching Cubes algorithm is taken from [here]https://github.com/rogrosso/tmc.
It has been modified heavily to be integrated into a graphical user interface.

## External libraries

The graphics engine of this project builds upon the code base of the projects listed below.
Some of them have been altered slightly, which is why they are bundled in `LazyEngine/vendors` in this repository.
