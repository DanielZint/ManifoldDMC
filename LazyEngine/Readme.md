# LazyEngine
This project is a rather simple Graphics Engine using OpenGL and C++/CUDA.
It has been created mostly for educational purposes.
The overall architecture is loosely based on the Hazel-Engine (https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel), diverged quickly though.

This Engine has only been tested on Windows.
